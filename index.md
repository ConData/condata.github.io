### About

Goals - Texas Aid is here to do three things. Firstly, we are providing a geolocated, interactive map of mutual aid and relief efforts in the Lone Star State to get people connected with resources in the midst of the 2021 Texas Freeze. Secondly, we are actively collecting entries for new and emerging resources to keep Texans informed within their local communities. Thirdly, we are looking forward to rolling out a way to accept requests and connect Texans with aid in their areas. 

Mission - Texas Aid's mission is to provide Texans across the state with the resources they need in the communities they live in. As with all mutual aid, this is based in solidarity, not charity.  

Vision - Texas Aid was formed to acutely respond to the crisis unfolding in the aftermath of the 2021 Texas Freeze from Winter Storm Uri. Ongoinly, we will keep this resource up and active to provide Texans continuous support and encourage localized collabortion.
